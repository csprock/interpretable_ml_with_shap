## Getting Started

This project can be set up quickly using development containers, which provide a consistent and isolated environment for development.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Remote - Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) for VS Code

### Setup Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/csprock/interpretable_ml_with_shap.git
    cd interpretable_ml_with_shap
    ```

2. Open the project in VS Code:
    ```bash
    code .
    ```

3. When prompted to "Reopen in Container", click "Yes". Alternatively, you can:
    - Open the Command Palette (F1 or Ctrl+Shift+P)
